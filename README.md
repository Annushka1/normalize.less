normalize.less
==============

The LESS equivalent to normalize.css.

#About

	So here's the thing. I wanted to use normalize css ( Thank you, Nicolas Gallagher ) and I enjoy using less,... 
	However, most of my project work wants to pretend that boostrap doesn't exist. meh. Enter, Markus Reiter's normalize.less. 
	Still wasn't completely there.... So, forked.

	Most of the refactoring / updating is formatting related... oh and the ability to install it via bower. whee!
